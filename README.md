# Learning Platform
This project was our "improved" version of the canvas learning-platform which we completed as the 3rd semester project.   
It was our top priority throughout the semester to finish as many as _must have_(MoSCoW model) functions as possible and look for _should have_ and FrontEnd design as a finishing touch. We were also tasked with connecting and storing/retrieving information to a database were we used MySQL. Some of the functions we implemented are: <br/>
-Login system  <br/>
-Profile page
-Courses for delivering, updating and reviewing assignments  <br/>
-Message system for chatting between users and teachers/teacherassistants  <br/>
-Calendar  <br/>
